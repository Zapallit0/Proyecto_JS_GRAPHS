# Proyecto_JS_GRAPHS
College proyect with graphs, making a safer route with less human contact,  in Lima city in case a new pandemic appears
Using vis.js AS TEMPLATE modifing how this can work with diferent algorithm to show the best route in the city based on the number of people living on the 43 districts 
https://visjs.org

STEP 1: Creating paths 
After placing all the districts in the city with ids and names i need to figure it out how to make a funtion and logic on how to create a new path with the users requests.
I have the desing pending after this part but should have the same functionality the user select 2 districts and show a new graph from point A to point B

STEP 2: DESIGN
I created smth simple just to complete the presentation, im not finish with this yet. 

STEP 3:JS GRAPHS VIS.JS

I have to say that its my firts time working with JS and this kind of libraries or graphics model, but i can say i learn a lot. First I read my first doc to understand how vis.js works choose the best library that suits with my idea of project. Here comes the hardest part of these, for each node i had to create an object with different information, 44 nodes in total. After that the relations between nodes was a dense work but was worth it. All just to create the graphs on screen. So to resume i learn how to edit almost everything on this graphs. So in the end of these step i create 2 functions one to create a graph base on the user selections, 2 districts, and show all the paths. And the other is the thing that i undertand the least how to explore thru graphs i just saw that work and use it XD.

STEP 4: GOOGLE MAPS

In the first presentation my teacher was ok with that but told me to add directions to get to one place to another, so to add this feature the only thing that came to my mind was GOOGLE MAPS. To begin with this i never worked with APIs so i read, watched, and code to learn how this works. So i add the map but everytime the user select different districs the maps changed as well.

THIS WAS MY FIRST JOURNEY WITH JS APIS FROM 0 TO SMTH AT LEAST USEFUL. WAS A PRETTY GOOD EXPERIENCE. :3
